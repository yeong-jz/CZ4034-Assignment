I love how fast it is, the SSD really does make a difference, its ready to go in seconds compared to my PC, and if you are already part of the Apple community with an iPad or iPhone the experience is even better! You can text from you Mackbook, as well as Airdrop files and things to your other devices. People said, why would you buy that with such a small HDD and you cant even tell. With cloud computing it makes more sense and you dont really need the extra space! Its fast and runs all of my intensive Adobe programs with ease. The only drawback is that there are no USB ports, I wish the accessories that come with the MacBook Pro bundle from HSN had the little Dongle adapter that allows you to connect your USB to your Mac! Just a suggestion! :)", "This MacBook Pro is a fast any easy to use laptop. It syncs with all of my other Apple products.

", "just received yesterday but so far I love it!! easy to use and takes up no room-especially since it works on any surface so no mouse pad needed. feels a little cheap but don't let that fool you coz it woks very well. plus you don't want it to be too heavy anyway. I say give it Try...I do think you will really like it-if you don't-send it back. Nothing to Lose!!", " I like this thing a lot I'll let using this on my laptop and works a lot easier it works better than the mouse works ", "It is easy to connect and it does work.

Thought this would be the perfect desktop, but sadly it wasn't. It looked very nice, however the keyboard and mouse looked very cheap and not very durable. However the most bothersome thing was there was something very wrong with it right out of the box. First it took almost a whole day to book for the first time..... and I do mean a whole day. Very slow.... then when it finally did get to the point of actually being able to log in and use..... the video and audio was defective. ALL video would stagger, freeze, and skip. The audio would come and go, then make horrible cracking and static noise. All this was immediate from the very first log in.... I immediately packed it right back up and returned it...... It was awful. Plus it cost me $50 to send it back... Insult to injury..... "]]},
